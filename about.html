Engineering. He subsequently obtained an MSME in 1994 and Ph.D. in ME in 1997, both from Purdue University. He has since worked in industrial research positions with Goodrich Aerospace and Excel India till 2004. He has served as a Research Fellow at Lehigh University and as an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Tennessee Technological University from 2005 to 2010. He has been on the faculty of the Department of Applied Mechanics, Indian Institute of Technology Madras since 2010 and in the current rank since 2014.
<br><br>
He is also the co-founder of the IIT Madras pre-incubator Nirmaan and the associate faculty-in-charge of the IIT Madras Incubation Cell, which advises faculty and students entrepreneurship activities.
<br><br>
Dr. Panchagnula’s current research broadly focuses on fundamental interdisciplinary multiphase
thermal/ fluid phenomena including wetting, hysteresis in natural systems, spray formation physics,pulmonary aerosol transport, liquid-liquid wetting and spray combustion. His lab employs both experimental as well as theoretical inquiry techniques. He has worked on the problem of contactangle hysteresis and shown that it is an effect originating at the contact line. In addition, he has worked on wetting in partially miscible liquid-liquid systems such as oil/water thin film dynamics
with Marangoni effects. His recent research has focused on applying simulation and data analytics tools to fluid mechanics problems such as the behaviour of large crowds and turbulence. His complete list of published work can be found on Google Scholar.</p>
