                                                        <p>As Founder and Chairman, Venkat is the visionary behind LatentView Analytics. Venkat identified the potential demand for data analytics way back in 2005, well before the word entered common business lexicon. Venkat’s vision for LatentView was to grow it into the most trusted data analytics partner globally. In order to do so, Venkat identified three pillars on which he would build the company- attracting the brightest talent and skill, being disciplined and applying rigour in all aspects of the business and fostering a culture of empowerment and innovation allowing for new ideas to flourish. (More about this is available in the supporting document). From 2006 to 2014, Venkat served as Founder and CEO of LatentView. Under his leadership, LatentView emerged as one of the largest and fastest growing data analytics firms globally. It was well on its way to achieving the vision with which it was founded. It was the preferred and trusted partner to many Fortune 500 companies including Microsoft, PepsiCo, Sony Pictures etc. It employed close to 600 data analysts from Tier 1 engineering and business schools in India and the US.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>In spite of all these successes, Venkat felt he had reached the next stage in the company’s growth. It was never his ambition to build ‘a family run business.’ He wanted to transform it to a professionally run company that was built for long term success. So in 2014, Venkat brought on board Gopi Koteeswaran to take over as CEO. Gopi had previously served as the CEO of Philips Direct Life, headquartered in the Netherlands. Apart from Gopi’s impressive track record of building global companies, Venkat believed he would bring in a new perspective as an end-user of analytics in his previous roles. Venkat has since transitioned to the role of Chairman and plays a strategic role in the growth of the organization.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Prior to founding LatentView, Venkat was part of the global leadership team for Cognizant’s Communications practice where he was in charge of strategy and business development and growing the business to the $20m milestone. He has over 18 years of experience in management consulting, technology and global IT services management. When he’s not thinking about big data and analytics, Venkat indulges his passion for technological gadgets. His latest possessions include a Spire – a wearable that monitors your breathing patterns and gauges your state of mind. He also wears a Lumolift – a posture and activity tracker. He is also a value investor in the public markets. Venkat holds a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering from IIT, Madras, and an MBA from IIM, Calcutta.</p>
